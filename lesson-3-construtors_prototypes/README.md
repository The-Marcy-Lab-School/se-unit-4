# Unit 4 Lesson 3
## Constructors, Prototypes, and the Pseudoclassical Object Creation Pattern

### Key Terms
* constructor
* prototypal inheritance
* prototype object
* prototype property
* pseudoclassical object creation pattern

### Essential Question
* What are the benefits of using _constructors_ to create objects?
* What is the benefit of storing methods on the prototype of the constructor?
* What is the association between an object's prototype and its constructor?
* What are the ways in which we can examine the link between an object and its constructor?
* What is prototypal inheritance and how does it differ from class-based inheritance seen in object-oriented languages?
